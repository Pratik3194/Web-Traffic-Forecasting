# Web Traffic Forecasting

## Project Description
Prediction of website traffic sessions based on hourly data.  
A neural network model was trained to forecast future traffic trends.

## Dataset
- Features:  
  - Hour Index → Hour of the day  
  - Sessions → Number of sessions in that hour  

## Steps
1. Data preprocessing and normalization  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Neural network model training for forecasting  
4. Evaluation using RMSE and MAPE  

## Model Used
- Neural Network Regressor  

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
